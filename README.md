# cgs
Extensive game framework written in Kotlin.

## What is this?
CGS is a minigame framework I wrote in December of 2021. This project *was* closed-source, but unfortunately, a series of events led me to decide to open-source it.

## Why did I make it?
When [@itsthreazy](https://twitter.com/itsthreazy) & I were working on PvPBar, we decided to work on a Bunkers gamemode to introduce later on. We originally planned on using a game framework written by [xander](https://github.com/xanderume) (afaik he was the only one working on it), but scrapped it and decided to write our own due to the horrible code & structure that it had.

## How do I use this?
You'll need to do quite a bit of work on the project at its state right now to be able make it work. CGS heavily depends on several closed-source projects.

Have fun future scala-cgs users! ❤️❤️
